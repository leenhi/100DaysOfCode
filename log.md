**Today's Progress**: Created a Random Color Generator.

**Thoughts:** This project helped me understand how addEventListener() is used to trigger a click function. When the button is clicked, The javascript method of Math.Random() and Math.Round() were used to generate new values into the background.

**Today's Progress**: Created a Search Filter List

**Thoughts**: I learned how to filter through a list of names by using the search field. I struggled how to code JavaScript so this project has helped me create functions and loops by using filter(), toUpperCase(), and querySelectoryAll(). This project also helped me understand how to find text through the DOM by using toUpperCase().
